Getting started
npm install

Use Prettier w/ default settings
Linting is not used

Assumptions:

- user input can contain any character
- commands are case-insensitive
- ignore any extra inputs after final input needed in a command (i.e. ADD foo bar extra stuff)
- don't need international languages - hard coding message responses
